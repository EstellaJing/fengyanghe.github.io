Uncovering the signaling architecture in protein-protein interaction (PPI) can certainly benefit the understanding of disease mechanisms and promise to facilitate the therapeutic interventions. Therefore, it is important to reveal the signalling relationship from one protein to another in terms of activation and inhibition. In this paper, <!--excerpt--> we propose a new measurement to characterize the regulation relationship of a PPI pair. By utilizing both Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation and protein domain information, we developed a tool called: Predictor of Activation/Inhibition Regualtion Signaling pathway (PAIRS) that takes protein interaction pairs as input and gives both known and predicted result of the human protein regulation relationship in terms of activation and inhibition. It helps to give prognostic regulation information for further signalling pathway reconstruction. 

The hypergeometric test was adopted to measure the statistical significance of ER. The hypothesis test was designed to investigate the over-representation of GO or domain pairs appearing in the activation/inhibition dataset. The hypergeometric p-value is calculated as the probability of randomly drawing mâ€™ or more successes from the population in n total draws.

For $$ER\ge 1$$ the p-value is defined as:

$$
\sum\limits_{m'=m}^{n}{P(X=m')}=\sum\limits_{m'=m}^{n}{f(m';N,M,n)}=\sum\limits_{m'=m}^{n}{\frac{\left( \begin{matrix}
  M \\ 
  m' \\ 
\end{matrix} \right)\left( \begin{matrix}
  N-M \\ 
  n-m' \\ 
\end{matrix} \right)}{\left( \begin{matrix}
  N \\ 
  n \\ 
\end{matrix} \right)}}
$$ 

While $$ER<1$$ the p-value is defined as:

$$
\sum\limits_{m'=0}^{m}{P(X=m')}=\sum\limits_{m'=0}^{m}{f(m';N,M,n)}=\sum\limits_{m'=0}^{m}{\frac{\left( \begin{matrix}
  M \\ 
  m' \\ 
\end{matrix} \right)\left( \begin{matrix}
  N-M \\ 
  n-m' \\ 
\end{matrix} \right)}{\left( \begin{matrix}
  N \\ 
  n \\ 
\end{matrix} \right)}}
$$
